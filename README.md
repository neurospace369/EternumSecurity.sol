# 🔒 EternumSecurity.sol  
**Advanced Cryptographic Mesh Security & On-Chain Protection for Eternum**  

## 📖 Overview  
EternumSecurity.sol is the **core security contract** for Eternum’s decentralized infrastructure.  
This smart contract enforces cryptographic security, multi-signature authentication, and on-chain transaction validation to protect Eternum’s network.  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Cryptographic Mesh Security** – Implements ECDSA signatures & Merkle Proof validation.  
✅ **Multi-Signature Authorization** – Ensures only approved entities can validate critical transactions.  
✅ **On-Chain Security Protocols** – Mitigates replay attacks and unauthorized access attempts.  
✅ **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** – Restricts function execution to authorized roles.  
✅ **Immutable Audit Logging** – Securely logs transaction validations for transparency.  
✅ **Self-Healing Security Mechanisms** – Reacts to security breaches in real-time.  

## 🔧 Contract Structure  
- **`validateTransaction(bytes32 txHash, bytes memory signature)`**  
  - Verifies a transaction using cryptographic signing.  
- **`updateSigner(address signer, bool status)`**  
  - Manages approved signers for secure operations.  
- **`pause()` & `unpause()`**  
  - Allows emergency security responses via contract pausing.  
- **`triggerSecurityAlert(string memory reason)`**  
  - Emits on-chain security alerts in case of suspicious activity.  

## 📜 Deployment Status  
🚨 **Deployment is currently on hold until sufficient funds are available.**  
🔹 Smart contract development & security testing are ongoing.  

## 🛠️ Development & Testing
